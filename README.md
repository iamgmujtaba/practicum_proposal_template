# Data Science Practicum Proposal Template (IEEE Format)

This repository contains a comprehensive LaTeX template for data science master's students to develop their practicum proposals following IEEE formatting guidelines. The template is designed to help students create professional, well-structured academic documents that meet the requirements of graduate-level data science programs. With built-in guidance for each section, students can focus on developing substantive content while ensuring all necessary components are properly addressed.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this template is to standardize the format and structure of data science practicum proposals, making it easier for students to document their research plans and for faculty to evaluate them. By providing a consistent framework, the template helps ensure that all crucial aspects of a data science project are thoroughly addressed, from problem formulation and literature review to methodology and expected outcomes.

## Template Structure

The template includes the following sections, each with instructional text explaining what content should be included:

1. Abstract: Executive summary of the project (250 words)
2. Introduction/Background: Context and relevance of the practicum
3. Problem Statement: Clear articulation of the data science challenge
4. Related Work: Literature review and positioning within the field
5. Methodology/Approach: Detailed research design and analytical techniques
6. Data Analysis: Data sources, management, and ethical considerations
7. Expected Outcomes: Anticipated results and contributions
8. Timeline: Project schedule with milestones
9. Conclusion: Summary of proposal significance

## Technical Details

The template uses the IEEEtran document class with properly configured packages to support:

- Mathematical notations and equations
- Algorithm descriptions
- Data visualizations and figures
- Table formatting
- BibTeX citation management
- Code snippets
